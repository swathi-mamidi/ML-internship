    <h2>Stages of Tuberculosis</h2>
    <p>Tuberculosis can progress through different stages:</p>
<section style="display:flex;">
    <img style="width:500px;"src="R.jpg">
    <section>
    <h3>Latent TB Infection (LTBI)</h3>
    <p>In this stage, the person has TB bacteria in their body but does not show symptoms and cannot spread the disease to others.</p>
    <p>There are no specific symptoms for LTBI, but individuals may have a positive tuberculin skin test or blood test.</p>

    <h3>Active TB Disease</h3>
    <p>This stage occurs when TB bacteria become active and multiply, leading to symptoms.</p>
    <p>Common symptoms of active TB disease include persistent cough, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and chest pain.</p>

    <h3>Drug-Resistant TB</h3>
    <p>Drug-resistant TB refers to strains of TB bacteria that do not respond to standard treatments.</p>
    <p>Symptoms are similar to those of active TB disease, but specialized testing is required to determine drug resistance.</p>

    <h2>Tuberculosis Testing</h2>
    <p>Tuberculosis testing involves various diagnostic methods to detect the presence of TB bacteria in the body. It is crucial for early detection and effective treatment.</p>
  
    <h3>Common Diagnostic Methods:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Chest X-rays:</h3> X-ray images of the chest can reveal abnormalities in the lungs, such as infiltrates or cavities, which may indicate tuberculosis.</li>
      <li><h3>Sputum Test:</h3> This involves collecting sputum (phlegm) samples to examine under a microscope or culture in a laboratory to identify the presence of TB bacteria.</li>
      <li><h3>Tuberculin Skin Test (TST):</h3> A small amount of purified protein derivative (PPD) is injected under the skin, and the reaction is observed after 48-72 hours. A positive reaction indicates exposure to TB bacteria.</li>
      <li><h3>Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs):</h3> Blood tests that measure the release of interferon-gamma in response to TB-specific antigens. They help determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Testing Process:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Consultation: </h3>Visit a healthcare professional who will assess your symptoms, medical history, and potential risk factors for tuberculosis.</li>
      <li><h3>Testing Method Selection:</h3> Based on the assessment, the healthcare provider will recommend the appropriate diagnostic method(s) for testing.</li>
      <li><h3>Sample Collection:</h3>Depending on the testing method, samples such as sputum or blood will be collected for analysis.</li>
      <li><h3>Laboratory Analysis:</h3> The collected samples are sent to a laboratory, where they undergo microscopic examination, culturing, or specialized tests.</li>
      <li><h3>Results and Follow-up:</h3> Once the test results are available, the healthcare provider will discuss the findings with you, provide an accurate diagnosis, and recommend the appropriate treatment if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>Note that the specific testing methods and processes may vary depending on the healthcare facility and region.</p>
